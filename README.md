# VoidFletcher's Path of Exile 2 Loot Filters
This repo contains my loot filters, written from the ground up with the game economy as a core focus of the filter.

**SemiStrict:** A semi-strict and finely-tuned loot filter designed for **Path of Exile 2** Early Access economy. This filter prioritizes essential and high-value items while removing clutter, enabling a more streamlined and efficient gameplay experience.

**--- Stay sane, Exile ---**

## Please note that this filter is still a WIP. Check back for updates.
